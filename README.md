# question-classification

A framework to train a model to classify questions we generated with our first LLM.
A project I worked on very soon after I started to work in the field of NLP as it revealed obvious that we are lacking of evaluation methods in the community. I did few eperiments with the little amount of data I had back then, to increase and corrupt good questions. The results are poor in comparison to what we can do with LLM nowadays.

# Question Classification Framework

## Overview

**question-classification** is a framework designed for training models to classify questions generated using our initial Language Model. This project originated from my early experiences in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) when it became apparent that there was a lack of robust evaluation methods within the community. In response, I conducted a series of experiments using the limited french dataset available at that time. The primary objectives were to expand the dataset and introduce variations to enhance the quality of questions.

## Background

When I initially embarked on this project, the available data was limited, and the goal was to improve and diversify the pool of well-formed questions. However, it's important to note that the outcomes of these early experiments were modest, especially when compared to the advancements achieved with contemporary Language Models (LLMs).
